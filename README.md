## 🏁 Quick Start

This repository acts as a central hub for the code development by `TEAM_ID 11` for the course **"Advanced Deep Learning in Robotics"**.

#### 🎯 Objective of the Project

The main objective of the project is to implement an algorithm to learn from experience for faster(time-efficient) motion planning, for a motion task, with respect to the classical optimization-based planning approach.

#### 🔭 Technical Outline

The general goal of the project is to implement a deep learning solution to generate experiences on known world configurations based on an initial guess, and then using the experiences for faster decision making in motion planning. We ought to investigate multiple models and approaches for the above mentioned task and then experimenting with different tweaks here and there, to find the best solution. After sufficient generation of experiences, we want to test our results in the setup and compare its performance with the previous solution (Only optimized path approach).
<br>
If time permits, we want to generate various experiences for the same initial guess and save the best path.
